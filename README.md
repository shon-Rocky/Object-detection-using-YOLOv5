Waste Detection
==============

Waste Detection is a Python project that uses machine learning to detect and classify different types of waste. The project includes a pipeline for data ingestion, data validation, and model training.

## Workflows

1) onstants
2) entity
3) components
4) pipelines
5) app.py

Installation
------------

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git https://github.com/shon-Rocky/Object-detection-using-YOLOv5.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd Object-detection-using-YOLOv5
```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
-----

The `app.py` file contains the main function that runs the waste detection pipeline. The pipeline can be customized by modifying the configuration files in the `config` folder.

The `data_ingestion.py` file contains the code for ingesting data from various sources. The `data_validation.py` file contains the code for validating the ingested data. The `model_trainer.py` file contains the code for training the machine learning model.

The `utils` folder contains various utility functions that are used throughout the project.

The `templates` folder contains the HTML templates for the web application.

The `notebooks` folder contains Jupyter notebooks that were used for research and development.

The `Dockerfile` can be used to create a Docker image for the project.
